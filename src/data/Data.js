Yang tadinya Richard & Reinhard sulit sulit sekali mengerti tentang pelajaran sekolah yang lama, tapi di PACEs mereka ini, pelajaran mereka di ulang-ulang sampe mereka pun mengerti. Bahkan melihat supervisornya yang begitu sabar memberikan penjelasan sampai anak-anak mengerti. Bener-bener step by step. Dan yang menarik belajar mandiri dengan cara set goal mereka, mereka belajar untuk jujur, menilai tugas yang mereka kerjakan. Mereka bukan hanya belajar secara akademik tetapi juga belajar mengenai karakter-karakter yang baik skali untuk diterapkan dalam kehidupan mereka. dan di sekolah Mathetes ini , banyak sekali enricment class yang membuat anak-anak bisa berkarya mengembangkan potensi-potensi yang ada dalam diri mereka. ada kelah bahasa Inggris, Project, Art & Craft, Home Economics, FriYay, dsb",
